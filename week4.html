      <h2> Poor or rich</h2>
      <p>One day, a rich dad took his son on a trip to a poor village. He wanted to show his son how the people in the village lived. They spent time on a farm of one of the poorest families. 
        At the end of the day, the dad asked: “Did you see how poor they are? What did you learn?”The boy answered: “We have a dog, they have four. We have a pool, they have a river. We buy food and they grow theirs. We have walls to protect us, they have friends.”
        After they left, the boy wanted to tell his dad the truth. “Well, thanks for showing me how poor we are”, said the boy.

      <h3>The wish of 3 friends</h3>
      <P>Three guys stranded on a desert island find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish. 
        The first guy wishes he was off the island and come back home.
         The second guy wishes the same. 
        The third guy says: “I’m lonely. I wish two friends were back here.”</P>
        <h4>Never tell a lie</h4>
        <p>On his deathbed, a father advised his son to always speak the truth. The son promised that he would never tell a lie. 
          One day, while going to the city through a forest, he got surrounded by some robbers. One of them asked, “What do you have?” The boy answered, “I have fifty rupees.”
           They searched for him but couldn’t find anything. When they were about to go, the boy called out, “I am not telling a lie. See this fifty rupee note which I had hidden in my shirt.” 
          The leader of the robbers felt pleased with the truthfulness of the boy, gave him a hundred rupees as a reward and went away.</p>
          <h5>The boy and the barbershop</h5>
          <p>A young boy enters a barbershop and the barber whispers to his customer. “This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it to you.”
             The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, “Which do you want, son?” The boy takes the quarters and leaves. 
             “What did I tell you?” said the barber. After, when the customer leaves, the man sees the young baby coming out of the ice cream store.
              He said, “Hey, baby boy! Can I ask you a question? Why did you choose the quarter instead of the dollar bill?” 
            The boy licked his cone and replied, “Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!”</p>
